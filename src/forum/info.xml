<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>This is a very simple forum software. Works with UserSpice permission levels.  It's made to either work as a standalone forum or as a code example for you to fork (copy usersc/plugins/forum to usersc/plugins/yourname) so you can make your own more advanced forum.</description>
