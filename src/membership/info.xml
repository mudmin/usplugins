<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>Allows you to add membership options to your UserSpice project. Each membership option is one of your existing
  permission levels, except that it is automatically added when the person pays and remove when the time expires. Note: While this is a functional plugin, it is designed to be a starting point to developing your own custom membership system. You may have to add code and custom script to do some of the things that you want to do. </description>
