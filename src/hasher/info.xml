<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>This is the hasher plugin for UserSpice. If you want to upload plugins for others to download in SpiceShaker we need the latest hash.  Hashing is a great way to ensure files aren't changed between when you upload them and they are downloaded by your users.</description>
