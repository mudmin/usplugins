  <description>Essentially this has the client check in with the server every X amount of time to see if there are any tasks that need to be performed. This could be logging the client out, refreshing the page, redirecting, or sending a message. As of version 2.0, it allows you to see which of your users are online, where they're spending their time.  SPA Single Page Applications</description>
