<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>This plugin allows you to flag or tag a user with as many tags as you would like.
    These can be used for times that you don't want to create an entire permission for a user. Management is much more limited than the user management system, but it's quick and handy.  Includes functions to check if someone has a particular tag or not.
