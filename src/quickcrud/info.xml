<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>This plugin is for backend use only and provides automatic tables with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    functionality. It is just for quick and dirty use on the backend when it doesn't make sense to code a full page for each feature. Thanks to user Zoza it also includes a direct database editor.  Users with Master Account access can directly edit any table in their database with this plugin.
