<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) replaces phpmailer and allows you to send emails via an API to avoid a lot of the headaches of traditional SMTP. Sendinblue lets you send 300 emails per day, free of charge (no credit card required), which is perfect for password resets etc for most UserSpice projects.  Now accepts attachments. </description>
