<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>For users of UserSpice 5.0.0 through 5.2.5. To provide better security updates, we made some changes that require system updates to your UserSpice installation. The BEST thing to do is to update to the latest version, but we understand that may not be practical for some people. If that's the case, you can still use UserSpice services by installing this plugin. Once it's installed, you can look on the config page and make sure there aren't any errors and then you are free to delete the plugin.</description>
