<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>SendGrid (by Twilio) replaces phpmailer and allows you to send emails via an API to avoid a lot of the headaches of traditional SMTP. SendGrid lets you send 100 emails per day, free of charge, which is perfect for password resets etc for most UserSpice projects.</description>
