  <description>A system info dashboard based on http://phpsysinfo.github.io/phpsysinfo/. PLEASE NOTE: If you get an error about "com_dotnet" (usually on Windows), you need to make a change to your php.ini.  Find the path of the file in System Snapshot on the UserSpice Dashboard. Add the line "extension=php_com_dotnet.dll" on its own line (without quotes) and restart your server. </description>
