<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>This is the API Builder plugin for UserSpice. It gives you the tools you need to build secure APIs. Offers various modes of authentication from keypools to ip locking or a combination of security options.  Includes a built in generic UserSpice API to allow you to perform any action that a typical UserSpice non-admin user can do. Thanks to Mr. Serikus for the response code contributions.</description>
