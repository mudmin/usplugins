<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>The Uptime plugin allows you to check all your sites to see if they're online and get an alert (sms, push notification or email) to alert you that there is a problem. You will also get a follow up notification when the site comes back online. Sites do not have to be based on UserSpice to do a simple check, but a special UserSpice and Wordpress target files give you some extra info like php version and UserSpice/Wordpress version. Requires a CRON job. Documentation on plugin config page.</description>
