<!-- What does your plugin do? -->
  <description>This is a very powerful plugin that lets your run (and save!) direct MySQL queries on your database. Also includes a DB Browser.
  It is designed as an alternative to something like phpMyAdmin for people who know what they're doing!  Use at your own risk. It does not hold your hand
  in most situations. You can even paste reasonably sized SQL dumps into the textarea. Master Account Only.</description>
